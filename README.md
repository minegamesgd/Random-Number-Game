# Random-Number-Game
This code requires a password to start, which is "apple."
After the correct pasword is input, the game will ask you to choose a number betweeen 1 and 20.
Once successfull, the code will display "CORRECT" and unsuccessfull to be met with "NOPE. TRY AGAIN!" followed with the question to choose a number again.
The entire code is one big loop whether you "win" or "fail" every attempt.
